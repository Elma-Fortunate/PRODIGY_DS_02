Titanic Survival Prediction Model
By Elma Fortunate Phiri
About Dataset:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic
sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone
onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were
more likely to survive than others.
Abstract: To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. Explore
the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data
Aim: To build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely
to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
